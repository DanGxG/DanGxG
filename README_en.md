### 💻 My Showcase Projects

Here's a selection of projects I've worked on, showcasing a range of technologies and applications:

-   **[Entregas UDL - Academic Task Manager (Backend: UdLAPI)](https://github.com/DanGxG/UdLAPI)**: A self-hosted web application for students at the University of Lleida to manage academic deadlines, accessible at [entregasudl.live](https://entregasudl.live). It includes an automated scraper that extracts tasks from the Sakai LMS via a REST API. The entire system architecture uses `Docker` for containerization.
    *   **Key Technologies:** The backend (UdLAPI) is built with `Node.js` and `Express.js`, using `MySQL` for the database. The responsive frontend uses `Bootstrap`, and the application is served via `NGINX` as a reverse proxy with SSL support.

-   **[FuelRadar - Fuel Cost Optimizer](https://github.com/DanGxG/FuelRadar)**: A web application developed with `Grails` (a `Groovy`-based framework) that helps users optimize fuel expenses. It locates economical gas stations and plans efficient refueling stops. It integrates with the `Google Maps API` for location services, uses `MongoDB` for data storage, and consumes REST APIs to fetch government fuel prices and external vehicle consumption data. It features a responsive frontend developed with `Bootstrap` and user authentication managed by `Spring Security`.
    *   **Key Technologies:** `Grails (Groovy)`, `MongoDB`, `Google Maps API`, `REST APIs`, `Bootstrap`, `Spring Security`.

-   **[ChatGPTHeadless | SoraHeadless - Advanced AI Automation](https://github.com/DanGxG/ChatGPTHeadless)**: An automation system to interact with ChatGPT and Sora, designed to replicate the functionalities of their official APIs without incurring API costs. This project uses `Puppeteer` for browser automation and includes features like automatic login with CAPTCHA handling, element detection assisted by the `Gemini API`, and a robust RESTful API built with `Express.js`. The system is `Dockerized` for easy deployment and incorporates anti-bot detection techniques.
    *   **Key Technologies:** `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `Puppeteer`, `MongoDB`, `Axios`, `Docker`, `Gemini API`.

-   **[Video Game Bots (e.g., wowBuyingBot)](https://github.com/DanGxG/wowBuyingBot)**: Development of sophisticated bots for video games, primarily using `Python`. These bots implement `Computer Vision` techniques for screen analysis and interaction automation, enabling tasks such as automated purchasing or other in-game actions (e.g., in World of Warcraft).
    *   **Key Technologies:** `Python`, `Computer Vision`.

-   **[GoPlanifi](https://github.com/GoPlanifiTeam/GoPlanifi)**: A collaborative project developed using `Kotlin`.
-   
-   **[tiktokScraper](https://github.com/DanGxG/tiktokScraper)**: A specialized tool primarily crafted in `JavaScript` with `Shell` scripting, designed for extracting data from TikTok.

-   **[youtubeScraper](https://github.com/DanGxG/youtubeScraper)**: Another useful scraping tool, built with `JavaScript` and `Shell` scripts, tailored for gathering data from YouTube.
